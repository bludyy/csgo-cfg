# Bludy's Counter Strike Global Offensive Config

- CSGO Launch Options: -novid -high -refresh 144 -w 1280 -h 1024 -full

| Command |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| novid | Starting the game with this launch option will remove the Valve intro that normally plays at the beginning. A must-have launch option in my opinion, because I find that intro is annoying as hell. |
| high | This will start the game in high-priority mode. This launch option can help players with lower-end computers to get less lag and a few more fps, but it is not a guarantee. Test this launch option, if you don’t notice any improvement performance-wise, remove this launch option again. |
| refresh | You can force your monitor to run at a specific refresh rate with this launch option. This only makes sense if your monitors maximum refreshrate is higher than 60. If it isn’t and you set this launch option to 120, you can seriously damage your monitor. |
| w | Widht. |
| height | Height. |
| full | This launch option forces the game to run in fullscreen mode. The game will ignore this launch option, if -windowed / -window / -sw / -startwindowed option is also set. |
